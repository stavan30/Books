## State Location 

- State Update? Rerender the component it is defined in all + all the components chidlren.
- Find all the components that need to use this state.
- DEFINE THE STATE IN THE LOWEST COMMON PARENT.

## useEffect

- Its a function that we import from the React librabry.
- Used to run code when a component is initailly rendered and sometimes when it is rendered.
- useEffect function takes two arguments.
1. First Argument - is an arrow function that contains code(any functionality) we want to run.
2. Second Argument - is an array or nothing: these arguments control whether the function is executed on rerenders.

- The first argument which is the arrow function is going to be called automatically by React at very specific points in time.
- The useEffect is always called after an initial render (first render of an application).
